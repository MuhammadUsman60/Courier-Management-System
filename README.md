# Courier-Management-System
 The system provides various functionalities for managers, couriers, and customers. Managers can log in and out, register couriers, and set their status to active. They can also add shipment details, including weight, shipper information, receiver details (name, contact, location, and parcel payment details), and retrieve a list of shipments. Managers have the capability to assign shipments to couriers based on their proximity (within a 2km radius).  Couriers can also log in and out, view their assigned shipments, and update the status of shipments, indicating whether they have been received or delayed/rejected.  Additionally, managers can generate shipment track IDs and send them to customers, who can use these IDs to track their shipments.
